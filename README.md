# color-explorer
Shows all paths within a graph, in which each node is a color and nodes are connected if the colors are similar, while no color is used twice. Colors were gathered from a box of markers. This project was made to sort the markers in an intresting way.  
WARNING! Will lag a lot due to it being exported to web.

Made with godot.
